## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7, Part 1
    
    This lab was fun to do because of all the if statements we had to do in order to figure out when someone could park. We used bools, strings, and if statements to code the functions file. We learned how to use command line arguments to get the right amount of arguments in the terminal. It was cool using command line arguments to hold a string in each argument. This lab was a lot of less than, greater than, &, and, || arguments, so it was challenging using them correctly. But, we managed to figure it out and it was satisfying being able to run the program and tell us when we couldn't park. 

* Lab 8, Part 1
    
    This lab was one of the most challenging ones to code, which is why it's one of my favorites, because we learn more from it. We had to make an algorithm that would calculate the averages of scores using loops, vectors, conditionals, and if statements. This lab helped me understand vectors more and how they work in the code. It was also useful in understanding how to manipulate data stored in containers. The part where we had to iterate through the values to find the max and min was interesting. Overall, a very informative and fun lab to do. 

* Lab 6, Part 2
    
    This was one of the best labs we did all semester because it involved blackjack. We had to write a program that computes the score for a hand of blackjack. In the lab we used bool, if, string, vector, and command line arguments. It was fun learning how to play blackjack and then code what score each hand gives you. We could use our own program if we ever decide to play blackjack. I learned a lot about using if statements and how bool statements work.
